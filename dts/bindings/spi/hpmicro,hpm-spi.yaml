        the minimum time from the chip select assert to the first clock
        edge. If not set, the minimum supported delay is used.
        0 - 1/2 SCK period; 1 - 2/2 SCK period;
        2 - 3/2 SCK period; 3 - 4/2 SCK period;

      required: false
      description: |
        The minimum time that SPI CS should stay HIGH.
        ( SCK period / 2 ) * ( x + 1)

    dmas:
      description: |
        Optional TX & RX dma specifiers.  Each specifier will have a phandle
        reference to the dmac controller, the channel number, and peripheral
        trigger source.

        For example dmas for TX, RX on SERCOM3
           dmas = <&dmac 0 0xb>, <&dmac 1 0xa>;

    dma-names:
      description: |
        Required if the dmas property exists.  This should be "tx" and "rx"
        to match the dmas property.

        For example
           dma-names = "tx", "rx";
